        <p> About me:</p>
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">I recently graduated from Wayne State University with a Master's degree in Basic Medical Sciences. After three years, however, I learned that the world of academic science just wasn't for me. </p>
      <p class=p2>Once I attended a few workshops at Grand Circus, I found that coding was a natural fit for my skillset, and am really excited for my future in the field of development!</p>
